## JavaScript Loops

Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

````javascript
//instead of writing
text += starterPokemon[0] + "<br>";
text += starterPokemon[1] + "<br>";
text += starterPokemon[2] + "<br>";
text += starterPokemon[3] + "<br>";
text += starterPokemon[4] + "<br>";
text += starterPokemon[5] + "<br>";
//You can write:
for (let i = 0; i < starterPokemon.length; i++) {
  text += starterPokemon[i] + "<br>";
}
````

Different Kinds of Loops

JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

- `for` - loops through a block of code a number of times
- `for/in` - loops through the properties of an object
- `for/of` - loops through the values of an iterable object
- `while` - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
- `do/while` - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

The For Loop

The `for` loop has the following syntax:

````javascript
for (*statement 1*; *statement 2*; *statement 3*) {
 // *code block to be executed*
}
````

**Statement 1** is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

**Statement 2** defines the condition for executing the code block.

**Statement 3** is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

````javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
````

From the example above, you can read:

Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (let i = 0).

Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5).

Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.

**<u>Statement 1</u>**

Normally you will use statement 1 to initialize the variable used in the loop (let i = 0).

This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement 1 is optional.

You can initiate many values in statement 1 (separated by comma):

````javascript
for (let i = 0, len = starterPokemon.length, text = ""; i < len; i++) {
  text += starterPokemon[i] + "<br>";
}
````

And you can omit statement 1 (like when your values are set before the loop starts)

````javascript
let i = 2;
let len = starterPokemon.length;
let text = "";
for (; i < len; i++) {
  text += starterPokemon[i] + "<br>";
}
````

**<u>Statement 2</u>**

Often statement 2 is used to evaluate the condition of the initial variable.

This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement 2 is also optional.

If statement 2 returns true, the loop will start over again, if it returns false, the loop will end.

If you omit statement 2, you must provide a **break** inside the loop. Otherwise the loop will never end. This will crash your browser. Read about breaks in a later chapter of this tutorial.

**<u>Statement 3</u>**

Often statement 3 increments the value of the initial variable.

This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care, and statement 3 is optional.

Statement 3 can do anything like negative increment (i--), positive increment (i = i + 15), or anything else.

Statement 3 can also be omitted (like when you increment your values inside the loop):

````javascript
let i = 0;
let len = starterPokemon.length;
let text = "";
for (; i < len; ) {
  text += starterPokemon[i] + "<br>";
  i++;
}
````

Loop Scope

Using `var` in a loop:

````javascript
var i = 5;

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // some code
}

// Here i is 10
````

Using `let` in a loop:

````javascript
let i = 5;

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // some code
}

// Here i is 5
````

In the first example, using `var`, the variable declared in the loop redeclares the variable outside the loop.

In the second example, using `let`, the variable declared in the loop does not redeclare the variable outside the loop.

When `let` is used to declare the i variable in a loop, the i variable will only be visible within the loop.

The For In Loop

The JavaScript `for in` statement loops through the properties of an Object:

````javascript
for (key in object) {
  // code block to be executed
}
````

- The **for in** loop iterates over a **person** object
- Each iteration returns a **key** (x)
- The key is used to access the **value** of the key
- The value of the key is **person[x]**

````javascript
const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};

let text = "";
for (let x in person) {
  text += person[x];
}
````

For In Over Arrays

The JavaScript `for in` statement can also loop over the properties of an Array:

````javascript
for (variable in array) {
  code
}
````

````javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];

let txt = "";
for (let x in numbers) {
  txt += numbers[x];
}
````

Do not use **for in** over an Array if the index **order** is important.

The index order is implementation-dependent, and array values may not be accessed in the order you expect.

It is better to use a **for** loop, a **for of** loop, or **Array.forEach()** when the order is important.

The `forEach()` method calls a function (a callback function) once for each array element.

````javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];

let txt = "";
numbers.forEach(myFunction);

function myFunction(value, index, array) {
  txt += value;
}
````

Note that the function takes 3 arguments:

- The item value
- The item index
- The array itself

The JavaScript `for of` statement loops through the values of an iterable object.

It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more:

````javascript
for (variable of iterable) {
  // code block to be executed
}
````

**variable** - For every iteration the value of the next property is assigned to the variable. *Variable* can be declared with `const`, `let`, or `var`.

**iterable** - An object that has iterable properties.

**For/of** is not supported in Internet Explorer.

Looping over an Array:

````javascript
const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];

let text = "";
for (let x of cars) {
  text += x;
}
````

Looping over a string

````javascript
let language = "JavaScript";

let text = "";
for (let x of language) {
text += x;
}
````

The `while` loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

We can use the `while` loop to create any type of iteration we wish, including anything that we have previously done with a `for` loop. 

````javascript
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
````

````javascript
//for loop
for (let i = 0; i < 51; i++) {
   console.log(i);
}
//while loop
let i = 0;

while (i < 51) {
   console.log(i);
   i++;
}
````

If you forget to increase the variable used in the condition, the loop will never end. This will crash your browser.

The `do while` loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

````javascript
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
````

The example below uses a `do while` loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested

````javascript
do {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
while (i < 10);
````

Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end!

## JavaScript Array Iteration

Array iteration methods operate on every array item.

The Array forEach() Method

The `forEach()` method calls a function (a callback function) once for each array element.

Note that the function takes 3 arguments:

- The item value
- The item index
- The array itself

The example above uses only the value parameter. The example can be rewritten to:

````javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let txt = "";
numbers.forEach(myFunction);

function myFunction(value) {
 txt += value + "<br>";
}
````

The Array map() Method

The `map()` method creates a new array by performing a function on each array element.

The `map()` method does not execute the function for array elements without values.

The `map()` method does not change the original array.

This example multiplies each array value by 2:

````javascript
const numbers1 = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
const numbers2 = numbers1.map(myFunction);

function myFunction(value, index, array) {
 return value * 2;
}
````

Note that the function takes 3 arguments:

- The item value
- The item index
- The array itself

When a callback function uses only the value parameter, the index and array parameters can be omitted:

````javascript
const numbers1 = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
const numbers2 = numbers1.map(myFunction);

function myFunction(value) {
 return value * 2;
}
````

The Array filter() Method

The `filter()` method creates a new array with array elements that passes a test.

This example creates a new array from elements with a value larger than 18:

````javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
const over18 = numbers.filter(myFunction);

function myFunction(value, index, array) {
 return value > 18;
}
````

Note that the function takes 3 arguments:

- The item value
- The item index
- The array itself

In the example above, the callback function does not use the index and array parameters, so they can be omitted:

````javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
const over18 = numbers.filter(myFunction);

function myFunction(value) {
 return value > 18;
}
````

The Array reduce() Method

The `reduce()` method runs a function on each array element to produce (reduce it to) a single value.

The `reduce()` method works from left-to-right in the array. See also `reduceRight()`.

The `reduce()` method does not reduce the original array.

This example finds the sum of all numbers in an array:

````javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let sum = numbers.reduce(myFunction);

function myFunction(total, value, index, array) {
 return total + value;
}
````

Note that the function takes 4 arguments:

- The total (the initial value / previously returned value)
- The item value
- The item index
- The array itself

The example above does not use the index and array parameters. It can be rewritten to:

````javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let sum = numbers.reduce(myFunction);

function myFunction(total, value) {
 return total + value;
}
````

The `reduce()` method can accept an initial value:

````javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let sum = numbers.reduce(myFunction, 100);

function myFunction(total, value) {
 return total + value;
}
````

The Array reduceRight() Method

The `reduceRight()` method runs a function on each array element to produce (reduce it to) a single value.

The `reduceRight()` works from right-to-left in the array. See also `reduce()`.

The `reduceRight()` method does not reduce the original array.

This example finds the sum of all numbers in an array:

````javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let sum = numbers1.reduceRight(myFunction);

function myFunction(total, value, index, array) {
 return total + value;
}
````

Note that the function takes 4 arguments:

- The total (the initial value / previously returned value)
- The item value
- The item index
- The array itself

The example above does not use the index and array parameters. It can be rewritten to:

````javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let sum = numbers1.reduceRight(myFunction);

function myFunction(total, value) {
 return total + value;
}
````

The Array every() Method

The `every()` method check if all array values pass a test.

This example check if all array values are larger than 18:

````javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let allOver18 = numbers.every(myFunction);

function myFunction(value, index, array) {
 return value > 18;
}
````

Note that the function takes 3 arguments:

- The item value
- The item index
- The array itself

When a callback function uses the first parameter only (value), the other parameters can be omitted:

````javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let allOver18 = numbers.every(myFunction);

function myFunction(value) {
 return value > 18;
}
````

The Array some() Method

The `some()` method check if some array values pass a test.

This example check if some array values are larger than 18:

````javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let someOver18 = numbers.some(myFunction);

function myFunction(value, index, array) {
 return value > 18;
}
````

Note that the function takes 3 arguments:

- The item value
- The item index
- The array itself

The Array indexOf() Method

The `indexOf()` method searches an array for an element value and returns its position.

**Note:** The first item has position 0, the second item has position 1, and so on.

Search an array for the item "Apple":

````javascript
const fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let position = fruits.indexOf("Apple") + 1;
````

*array*.indexOf(*item*, *start*)

| *item*  | Required. The item to search for.                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *start* | Optional. Where to start the search. Negative values will start at the given position counting from the end, and search to the end. |

`Array.indexOf()` returns -1 if the item is not found.

If the item is present more than once, it returns the position of the first occurrence.

The Array lastIndexOf() Method

`Array.lastIndexOf()` is the same as `Array.indexOf()`, but returns the position of the last occurrence of the specified element.

Search an array for the item "Apple":

````javascript
const fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let position = fruits.lastIndexOf("Apple") + 1;
````

*array*.lastIndexOf(*item*, *start*)

| *item*  | Required. The item to search for                             |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *start* | Optional. Where to start the search. Negative values will start at the given position counting from the end, and search to the beginning |

------

The Array includes() Method

ECMAScript 2016 introduced `Array.includes()` to arrays. This allows us to check if an element is present in an array (including NaN, unlike indexOf).

````javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];

fruits.includes("Mango"); // is true
````

*array*.includes(*search-item*)

Array.includes() allows to check for NaN values. Unlike Array.indexOf().

The first browser versions with full support are:

The Array find() Method

The `find()` method returns the value of the first array element that passes a test function.

This example finds (returns the value of) the first element that is larger than 18:

````javascript
const numbers = [4, 9, 16, 25, 29];
let first = numbers.find(myFunction);

function myFunction(value, index, array) {
 return value > 18;
}
````

Note that the function takes 3 arguments:

- The item value
- The item index
- The array itself

The Array findIndex() Method

The `findIndex()` method returns the index of the first array element that passes a test function.

This example finds the index of the first element that is larger than 18:

````javascript
const numbers = [4, 9, 16, 25, 29];
let first = numbers.findIndex(myFunction);

function myFunction(value, index, array) {
 return value > 18;
}
````

Note that the function takes 3 arguments:

- The item value
- The item index
- The array itself

The Array.from() Method

The `Array.from()` method returns an Array object from any object with a length property or any iterable object.

Create an Array from a String:

````javascript
Array.from("ABCDEFG")  // Returns [A,B,C,D,E,F,G]
````

The Array Keys() Method

The `Array.keys()` method returns an Array Iterator object with the keys of an array.

Create an Array Iterator object, containing the keys of the array:

````javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
const keys = fruits.keys();

for (let x of keys) {
 text += x + "<br>";
}
````
