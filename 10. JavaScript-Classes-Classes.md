## JavaScript Classes

Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.

Classes are in fact "special functions", and just as you can define function expressions and function declarations, the class syntax has two components: class expressions and class declarations.

One way to define a class is using a **class declaration**. To declare a class, you use the `class` keyword with the name of the class ("Rectangle" here).

```
class Rectangle {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}
```

An important difference between function declarations and class declarations is that while functions can be called in code that appears before they are defined, classes must be defined before they can be constructed. Code like the following will throw a ReferenceError:

````javascript
const p = new Rectangle(); // ReferenceError

class Rectangle {}
````

This occurs because while the class is hoisted its values are not initialized.

A class expression is another way to define a class. Class expressions can be named or unnamed. The name given to a named class expression is local to the class's body. However, it can be accessed via the name property.

````javascript
// unnamed
let Rectangle = class {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
};
console.log(Rectangle.name);
// output: "Rectangle"

// named
let Rectangle = class Rectangle2 {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
};
console.log(Rectangle.name);
// output: "Rectangle2"
````

**Note:** Class **expressions** must be declared before they can be used (they are subject to the same hoisting restrictions as described in the [class declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#class_declarations) section).

A JavaScript class is **not** an object.

It is a **template** for JavaScript objects.

When you have a class, you can use the class to create objects:

````javascript
class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
}

let myCar1 = new Car("Ford", 2014);
let myCar2 = new Car("Audi", 2019);
````

The example above uses the **Car class** to create two **Car objects**.

The constructor method is called automatically when a new object is created.

The constructor method is a special method:

- It has to have the exact name "constructor"
- It is executed automatically when a new object is created
- It is used to initialize object properties

If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method.

Class methods are created with the same syntax as object methods.

Use the keyword `class` to create a class.

Always add a `constructor()` method.

Then add any number of methods.

```javascript
//Rough Synax
class ClassName {
  constructor() { ... }
  method_1() { ... }
  method_2() { ... }
  method_3() { ... }
}
```

````javascript
//Class method named "age", that returns the Car age
class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
  age() {
    let date = new Date();
    return date.getFullYear() - this.year;
  }
}

let myCar = new Car("Ford", 2014);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"My car is " + myCar.age() + " years old.";

//You can send parameters to Class methods
class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
  age(x) {
    return x - this.year;
  }
}

let date = new Date();
let year = date.getFullYear();

let myCar = new Car("Ford", 2014);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML=
"My car is " + myCar.age(year) + " years old.";
