## JavaScript More In Depth Into Strings

A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.

The string data type is a collection type. Data types that are comprised of smaller pieces are called **collection data types**, or simply **collection types**.

A **character** is a string that contains exactly one element, such as `'a'`, `"?"`, or even `" "` (a single space character).

Strings are built out of characters, and because of this we can break down a string into its individual characters. Each of these characters have a length of one

To add punctuation to a string

| Code | Result | Description  |
| :--- | :----- | :----------- |
| \'   | '      | Single quote |
| \"   | "      | Double quote |
| \\   | \      | Backslash    |

To add white space into a string

| Code | Result               |
| :--- | :------------------- |
| \b   | Backspace            |
| \f   | Form Feed            |
| \n   | New Line             |
| \r   | Carriage Return      |
| \t   | Horizontal Tabulator |
| \v   | Vertical Tabulator   |

Primitive values, like the string "John Doe", cannot have properties or methods (because they are not objects).

But with JavaScript, methods and properties are also available to primitive values, because JavaScript treats primitive values as objects when executing methods and properties.

The `length` property returns the length of a string

````javascript
let txt = "Stardew Valley";
let length = txt.length;
````

The `indexOf()` method returns the index of (the position of) the `first` occurrence of a specified text in a string

````javascript
let str = "Please locate where 'locate' occurs!";
str.indexOf("locate");
````

The `lastIndexOf()` method returns the index of the **last** occurrence of a specified text in a string

````javascript
let str = "Please locate where 'locate' occurs!";
str.lastIndexOf("locate");
````

Both `indexOf()`, and `lastIndexOf()` return -1 if the text is not found:

````javascript
let str = "Please locate where 'locate' occurs!";
str.lastIndexOf("John");
````

Both methods accept a second parameter as the starting position for the search

````javascript
let str = "Please locate where 'locate' occurs!";
str.indexOf("locate", 15);
````

The `lastIndexOf()` methods searches backwards (from the end to the beginning), meaning: if the second parameter is `15`, the search starts at position 15, and searches to the beginning of the string

````javascript
let str = "Please locate where 'locate' occurs!";
str.lastIndexOf("locate", 15);
````

The `search()` method searches a string for a specified value and returns the position of the match

````javascript
let str = "Please locate where 'locate' occurs!";
str.search("locate");
````

The two methods, `indexOf()` and `search()`, are **equal?**

They accept the same arguments (parameters), and return the same value?

The two methods are **NOT** equal. These are the differences:

- The `search()` method cannot take a second start position argument.
- The `indexOf()` method cannot take powerful search values (regular expressions).

## JavaScript Ordered Collections

We defined strings as *sequential* collections of characters. This means that the individual characters that make up the string are assumed to be in a particular order from left to right.

Collection types that allow their elements to be ordered are known as **ordered collections**

**Bracket notation** is the special syntax that allows us to access the individual characters that make up a string. 

**Index** is the location of an item in a string, array etc.

An expression of the form `someString[i]` gives the character at index `i`.

````javascript
let jsCreator = "Brendan Eich";
let firstInitial = jsCreator[0];
let lastInitial = jsCreator[8];

let outputStr = "JavaScript was created by somebody with initials " +
   firstInitial + "." +
   lastInitial + ".";

console.log(outputStr); //output: JavaScript was created by somebody with initials B.E.
````

````javascript
let jsCreator = "Brendan Eich";

console.log(jsCreator[-1]); //output: undefined
console.log(jsCreator[42]); //output: undefined
````

## JavaScript Template Literals

Template literals are literals delimited with backticks (```), allowing embedded expressions called *substitutions*.

- *Untagged* template literals result in strings, which makes them useful for string interpolation (and multiline strings, since unescaped newlines are allowed).
- *Tagged* template literals call a function (the *tag function*) with an array of any text segments from the literal followed by arguments with the values of any substitutions, which is useful for [DSLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language).

Template literals are sometimes informally called *template strings*, but they aren't string literals and can't be used everywhere a string literal can be used. Also, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it's up to the tag function what it creates (if anything).

````javascript
let text = `Hello World!`;
````

With **template literals**, you can use both single and double quotes inside a string:

````javascript
let text = `"Stardew Valley's" home screen should say "Real Gamers Play Farming Sims"`
````

**Template literals** allows multiline strings:

````javascript
let text = 
`"Stardew Valley's" home 
screen should say "Real Gamers Play 
Farming Sims"`
````

**Template literals** provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings.

The method is called string interpolation.

````javascript
let first = "Stardew";
let last = "Valley";

let text = `${first}, ${last} is the best!`;
````

Automatic replacing of variables with real values is called **string interpolation**.

**Template literals** allow expressions in strings:

````javascript
let price = 10;
let VAT = 0.25;

let total = `Total: ${(price * (1 + VAT)).toFixed(2)}`;
console.log(total); //output: Total: 12.50
````

Automatic replacing of expressions with real values is called **string interpolation**.
