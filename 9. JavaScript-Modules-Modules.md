## JavaScript Modules

As our application grows bigger, we want to split it into multiple files, so called ‚Äúmodules‚Äù. A module may contain a class or a library of functions for a specific purpose.

For a long time, JavaScript existed without a language-level module syntax. That wasn‚Äôt a problem, because initially scripts were small and simple, so there was no need.

But eventually scripts became more and more complex, so the community invented a variety of ways to organize code into modules, special libraries to load modules on demand.

The language-level module system appeared in the standard in 2015, gradually evolved since then, and is now supported by all major browsers and in Node.js. So we‚Äôll study the modern JavaScript modules from now on.

A module is just a file. One script is one module. As simple as that.

Modules can load each other and use special directives `export` and `import` to interchange functionality, call functions of one module from another one:

- `export` keyword labels variables and functions that should be accessible from outside the current module.
- `import` allows the import of functionality from other modules.

For instance, if we have a file `sayHi.js` exporting a function:

```javascript
// üìÅ sayHi.js
export function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}
```

‚Ä¶Then another file may import and use it:

```javascript
// üìÅ main.js
import {sayHi} from './sayHi.js';

alert(sayHi); // function...
sayHi('Link'); // Hello, Link!
```

The `import` directive loads the module by path `./sayHi.js` relative to the current file, and assigns exported function `sayHi` to the corresponding variable.

As modules support special keywords and features, we must tell the browser that a script should be treated as a module, by using the attribute `<script type="module">`.

```html
<!doctype html>
<script type="module">
  import {sayHi} from './say.js';

  document.body.innerHTML = sayHi('Link');
</script>
```

The browser automatically fetches and evaluates the imported module (and its imports if needed), and then runs the script.

**Modules work only via HTTP(s), not locally**

If you try to open a web-page locally, via `file://` protocol, you‚Äôll find that `import/export` directives don‚Äôt work. Use a local web-server, such as [static-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/static-server#getting-started) or use the ‚Äúlive server‚Äù capability of your editor, such as VS Code [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to test modules.

Core module features

What‚Äôs different in modules, compared to ‚Äúregular‚Äù scripts?

There are core features, valid both for browser and server-side JavaScript.

Always ‚Äúuse strict‚Äù

Modules always work in strict mode. E.g. assigning to an undeclared variable will give an error.

```html
<script type="module">
  a = 5; // error
</script>
```

Module-level scope

Each module has its own top-level scope. In other words, top-level variables and functions from a module are not seen in other scripts.

In the example below, two scripts are imported, and `hello.js` tries to use `user` variable declared in `user.js`. It fails, because it‚Äôs a separate module (you‚Äôll see the error in the console):

```html
<!doctype html>
<script type="module" src="user.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="hello.js"></script>
```

Modules should `export` what they want to be accessible from outside and `import` what they need.

- `user.js` should export the `user` variable.
- `hello.js` should import it from `user.js` module.

In other words, with modules we use import/export instead of relying on global variables.

This is the correct variant:

```javascript
import {user} from './user.js';

document.body.innerHTML = user; // Link
```

In the browser, if we talk about HTML pages, independent top-level scope also exists for each `<script type="module">`.

Here are two scripts on the same page, both `type="module"`. They don‚Äôt see each other‚Äôs top-level variables:

```html
<script type="module">
  // The variable is only visible in this module script
  let user = "Link";
</script>

<script type="module">
  alert(user); // Error: user is not defined
</script>
```

**Please note:**

In the browser, we can make a variable window-level global by explicitly assigning it to a `window` property, e.g. `window.user = "Link"`.

Then all scripts will see it, both with `type="module"` and without it.

That said, making such global variables is frowned upon. Please try to avoid them.

A module code is evaluated only the first time when imported

If the same module is imported into multiple other modules, its code is executed only once, upon the first import. Then its exports are given to all further importers.

The one-time evaluation has important consequences, that we should be aware of.

First, if executing a module code brings side-effects, like showing a message, then importing it multiple times will trigger it only once ‚Äì the first time:

```javascript
// üìÅ alert.js
alert("Module is evaluated!");
// Import the same module from different files

// üìÅ 1.js
import `./alert.js`; // Module is evaluated!

// üìÅ 2.js
import `./alert.js`; // (shows nothing)
```

The second import shows nothing, because the module has already been evaluated.

There‚Äôs a rule: top-level module code should be, and used for initialization, creation of module-specific internal data structures. If we need to make something callable multiple times ‚Äì we should export it as a function, like we did with `sayHi` above.
