## JavaScript Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

````javascript
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}
````

A JavaScript function is defined with the `function` keyword, followed by a **name**, followed by parentheses **()**.

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
**(\*parameter1, parameter2, ...\*)**

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: **{}**

````javascript
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
````

Function **parameters** are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

Function **arguments** are the **values** received by the function when it is invoked.

Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

The code inside the function will execute when "something" **invokes** (calls) the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)

When JavaScript reaches a `return` statement, the function will stop executing.

If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

Functions often compute a **return value**. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller"

````javascript
let x = myFunction(4, 3);   // Function is called, return value will end up in x

function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;             // Function returns the product of a and b
} //value of x = 12
````

With functions you can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.

Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.

Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.

````javascript
//Instead of using a variable to store the return value of a function:
let x = toCelsius(77);
let text = "The temperature is " + x + " Celsius";
//You can use the function directly, as a variable value:
let text = "The temperature is " + toCelsius(77) + " Celsius";
````

Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become **LOCAL** to the function.

Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.

````javascript
// code here can NOT use carName

function myFunction() {
  let carName = "Volvo";
  // code here CAN use carName
}

// code here can NOT use carName
````

Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.

Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.

While the function declaration above is syntactically a statement, functions can also be created by a function expression

Such a function can be **anonymous**; it does not have to have a name. For example, the function `square` could have been defined as:

Such a function can be **anonymous**; it does not have to have a name. For example, the function `square` could have been defined as:

````javascript
const square = function(number) { return number * number }
var x = square(4) // x gets the value 16
````

However, a name *can* be provided with a function expression. Providing a name allows the function to refer to itself, and also makes it easier to identify the function in a debugger's stack traces:

````javascript
const factorial = function fac(n) { return n < 2 ? 1 : n * fac(n - 1) }
console.log(factorial(3))
````

Function expressions are convenient when passing a function as an argument to another function. The following example shows a `map` function that should receive a function as first argument and an array as second argument:

````javascript
function map(f, a) {
  let result = []; // Create a new Array
  let i; // Declare variable
  for (i = 0; i != a.length; i++)
    result[i] = f(a[i]);
  return result;
}
````

In the following code, the function receives a function defined by a function expression and executes it for every element of the array received as a second argument:

````javascript
function map(f, a) {
  let result = []; // Create a new Array
  let i; // Declare variable
  for (i = 0; i != a.length; i++)
    result[i] = f(a[i]);
  return result;
}
const f = function(x) {
   return x * x * x;
}
let numbers = [0, 1, 2, 5, 10];
let cube = map(f,numbers);
console.log(cube); //Function returns: [0, 1, 8, 125, 1000].
````

In JavaScript, a function can be defined based on a condition. For example, the following function definition defines `myFunc` only if `num` equals `0`:

````javascript
var myFunc;
if (num === 0) {
  myFunc = function(theObject) {
    theObject.make = 'Toyota';
  }
}
````

In addition to defining functions as described here, you can also use the [`Function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) constructor to create functions from a string at runtime, much like [`eval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval).

A **method** is a function that is a property of an object. 

*Defining* a function does not *execute* it. Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.

**Calling** the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters. For example, if you define the function `square`, you could call it as follows:

````javascript
square(5); //The preceding statement calls the function with an argument of 5. The function executes its statements and returns the value 25
````

Functions must be *in scope* when they are called, but the function declaration can be hoisted (appear below the call in the code), as in this example:

````javascript
console.log(square(5));
/* ... */
function square(n) { return n * n }
````

The arguments of a function are not limited to strings and numbers. You can pass whole objects to a function.

There are other ways to call functions. There are often cases where a function needs to be called dynamically, or the number of arguments to a function vary, or in which the context of the function call needs to be set to a specific object determined at runtime.

It turns out that *functions are themselves objects*â€”and in turn, these objects have methods.

Every JavaScript function is actually a `Function` object. This can be seen with the code `(function(){}).constructor === Function`, which returns true.

Constructor

- [`Function()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function)

  Creates a new `Function` object. Calling the constructor directly can create functions dynamically but suffers from security and similar (but far less significant) performance issues to [`Global_Objects/eval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval). However, unlike eval, the `Function` constructor creates functions that execute in the global scope only.

Instance properties

- [`Function.prototype.arguments`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/arguments)

  An array corresponding to the arguments passed to a function. This is deprecated as a property of [`Function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function). Use the [`arguments`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments) object (available within the function) instead.

- [`Function.prototype.caller`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/caller)

  Specifies the function that invoked the currently executing function. This property is deprecated, and is only functional for some non-strict functions.

- [`Function.prototype.displayName`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/displayName)

  The display name of the function.

- [`Function.prototype.length`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/length)

  Specifies the number of arguments expected by the function.

- [`Function.prototype.name`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/name)

  The name of the function.

Instance methods

- `Function.prototype.apply(thisArg [, argsArray\])`

  Calls a function and sets its `this` to the provided `thisArg`. Arguments can be passed as an [`Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) object.

- `Function.prototype.bind(thisArg[, arg1[, arg2[, ...argN\]]])`

  Creates a new function which, when called, has its `this` set to the provided `thisArg`. Optionally, a given sequence of arguments will be prepended to arguments provided the newly-bound function is called.

- `Function.prototype.call(thisArg[, arg1, arg2, ...argN\])`

  Calls a function and sets its `this` to the provided value. Arguments can be passed as they are.

- `Function.prototype.toString()`

  Returns a string representing the source code of the function. Overrides the [`Object.prototype.toString`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString) method.

Difference between Function constructor and function declaration

Functions created with the `Function` constructor do not create closures to their creation contexts; they always are created in the global scope. When running them, they will only be able to access their own local variables and global ones, not the ones from the scope in which the `Function` constructor was created. This is different from using [`Global_Objects/eval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval) with code for a function expression.

```javascript
let x = 10;

function createFunction1() {
    let x = 20;
    return new Function('return x;'); // this |x| refers global |x|
}

function createFunction2() {
    let x = 20;
    function f() {
        return x; // this |x| refers local |x| above
    }
    return f;
}

let f1 = createFunction1();
console.log(f1());          // 10
let f2 = createFunction2();
console.log(f2());          // 20
```

While this code works in web browsers, `f1()` will produce a `ReferenceError` in Node.js, as `x` will not be found. This is because the top-level scope in Node is not the global scope, and `x` will be local to the module.

## JavaScript Scope

Scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during runtime. In other words, scope determines the visibility of variables and other resources in areas of your code.

Understanding `scope` will make your code stand out, reduce errors and help you make powerful design patterns with it.

In the JavaScript language there are two types of scopes:

- Global Scope
- Local Scope

Variables defined **inside a function** are in local scope while variables defined outside of a function are in the global scope. Each function when invoked creates a new scope.

When you start writing JavaScript in a document, you are already in the Global scope. There is only one Global scope throughout a JavaScript document. A variable is in the Global scope if itâ€™s defined outside of a function.

````javascript
// the scope is by default global
let name = 'Link';
````

Variables inside the Global scope can be accessed and altered in any other scope.

````javascript
let name = 'Link';

console.log(name); // logs 'Link'

function logName() {
    console.log(name); // 'name' is accessible here and everywhere else
}

logName(); // logs 'Link'
````

Variables defined inside a function are in the local scope. And they have a different scope for every call of that function. This means that variables having the same name can be used in different functions. This is because those variables are bound to their respective functions, each having different scopes, and are not accessible in other functions.

````javascript
// Global Scope
function someFunction() {
    // Local Scope #1
    function someOtherFunction() {
        // Local Scope #2
    }
}

// Global Scope
function anotherFunction() {
    // Local Scope #3
}
// Global Scope
````

Block statements like `if` and `switch` conditions or `for` and `while` loops, unlike functions, donâ€™t create a new scope. Variables defined inside of a block statement will remain in the scope they were already in.

```javascript
if (true) {
    // this 'if' conditional block doesn't create a new scope
    let name = 'Link'; // name is still in the global scope
}

console.log(name); // logs 'Link'
```

Global scope lives as long as your application lives. Local Scope lives as long as your functions are called and executed.

Lexical Scope means that in a nested group of functions, the inner functions have access to the variables and other resources of their parent scope. This means that the child functions are lexically bound to the execution context of their parents. Lexical scope is sometimes also referred to as Static Scope.

````javascript
function grandfather() {
    var name = 'Link';
    // likes is not accessible here
    function parent() {
        // name is accessible here
        // likes is not accessible here
        function child() {
            // Innermost level of the scope chain
            // name is also accessible here
            var likes = 'Rupees';
        }
    }
}
````

The thing you will notice about lexical scope is that it works forward, meaning `name` can be accessed by its childrenâ€™s execution contexts. But it doesnâ€™t work backward to its parents, meaning that the variable `likes` cannot be accessed by its parents. This also tells us that variables having the same name in different execution contexts gain precedence from top to bottom of the execution stack. A variable, having a name similar to another variable, in the innermost function (topmost context of the execution stack) will have higher precedence.

The concept of closures is closely related to Lexical Scope, which we studied above. A Closure is created when an inner function tries to access the scope chain of its outer function meaning the variables outside of the immediate lexical scope. Closures contain their own scope chain, the scope chain of their parents, and the global scope.

A closure can not only access the variables defined in its outer function but also the arguments of the outer function.

A closure can also access the variables of its outer function even after the function has returned. This allows the returned function to maintain access to all the resources of the outer function.

When you return an inner function from a function, that returned function will not be called when you try to call the outer function. You must first save the invocation of the outer function in a separate variable and then call the variable as a function. Consider this example:

````javascript
function sayHi() {
    name = 'Link';
    return function () {
        console.log('Hi ' + name);
    }
}

sayHi(); // nothing happens, no errors

// the returned function from sayHi() gets saved in greetPerson
greetPerson = sayHi();

 // calling greetPerson calls the returned function from the sayHi() function
greetPerson(); // logs 'Hi Link'
````

The key thing to note here is the `greetPerson` function can access the name variable of the `greet` function even after it has been returned. One way to call the returned function from the `sayHi` function without variable assignment is by using parentheses `()` two times `()()` like this:

````javascript
function sayHi() {
    name = 'Link';
    return function () {
        console.log('Hi ' + name);
    }
}

sayHi()(); // logs 'Hi Link'
````

## The JavaScript *this* Keyword

````javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id       : 5566,
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};
````

The JavaScript `this` keyword refers to the object it belongs to.

It has different values depending on where it is used:

- In a method, `this` refers to the **owner object**.
- Alone, `this` refers to the **global object**.
- In a function, `this` refers to the **global object**.
- In a function, in strict mode, `this` is `undefined`.
- In an event, `this` refers to the **element** that received the event.
- Methods like `call()`, and `apply()` can refer `this` to **any object**.

In an object method, `this` refers to the "**owner**" of the method.

In the example on the top of this page, `this` refers to the **person** object.

The **person** object is the **owner** of the **fullName** method.

````javascript
fullName : function() {
  return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
}
````

When used alone, the **owner** is the Global object, so `this` refers to the Global object.

In a browser window the Global object is `[object Window]`:

````javascript
let x = this;
````

In **strict mode**, when used alone, `this` also refers to the Global object `[object Window]`:

````javascript
"use strict";
let x = this;
````

In a JavaScript function, the owner of the function is the **default** binding for `this`.

So, in a function, `this` refers to the Global object `[object Window]`.

````javascript
function myFunction() {
  return this;
}
````

JavaScript **strict mode** does not allow default binding.

So, when used in a function, in strict mode, `this` is `undefined`.

````javascript
"use strict";
function myFunction() {
  return this;
}
````

In these examples, `this` is the **person** object (The person object is the "owner" of the function):

````javascript
const person = {
  firstName  : "John",
  lastName   : "Doe",
  id         : 5566,
  myFunction : function() {
    return this;
  }
};
````

In other words: **this.firstName** means the **firstName** property of **this** (person) object.

## Explicit Function Binding

The `call()` and `apply()` methods are predefined JavaScript methods.

They can both be used to call an object method with another object as argument.

You can read more about `call()` and `apply()` later in this tutorial.

In the example below, when calling person1.fullName with person2 as argument, `this` will refer to person2, even if it is a method of person1:

````javascript
const person1 = {
 fullName: function() {
  return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
 }
}
const person2 = {
 firstName:"John",
 lastName: "Doe",
}
person1.fullName.call(person2); // Will return "John Doe"
````

## JavaScript Arrow Function

Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:

````javascript
//javascript function
hello = function() {
  return "Stardew Valley";
}
//javascript arrow function
hello = () => {
  return "Stardew Valley";
}
````

If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, you can remove the brackets *and* the `return` keyword:

````javascript
hello = () => "Stardew Valley";
//Note: This works only if the function has only one statement.
````

If you have parameters, you pass them inside the parentheses:

````javascript
hello = val => "Hello " + val;
````

An **arrow function expression** is a compact alternative to a traditional [function expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function), but is limited and can't be used in all situations. Arrow function expressions are best suited for non-method functions. 

**Differences & Limitations:**

- Does not have its own bindings to [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) or [`super`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super), and should not be used as [`methods`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Method).
- Does not have [`new.target`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new.target) keyword.
- Not suitable for [`call`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call), [`apply`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply) and [`bind`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) methods, which generally rely on establishing a [scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope).
- Can not be used as [constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Constructor).
- Can not use [`yield`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/yield), within its body.

Let's see what happens when we try to use them as methods:

````javascript
'use strict';

var obj = { // does not create a new scope
  i: 10,
  b: () => console.log(this.i, this),
  c: function() {
    console.log(this.i, this);
  }
}

obj.b(); // prints undefined, Window {...} (or the global object)
obj.c(); // prints 10, Object {...}
````



The handling of `this` is different in arrow functions compared to regular functions.

In short, with arrow functions there are no binding of `this`.

In regular functions the `this` keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever.

With arrow functions the `this` keyword *always* represents the object that defined the arrow function.

Perhaps the greatest benefit of using Arrow functions is with DOM-level methods (setTimeout, setInterval, addEventListener) that usually required some kind of closure, call, apply or bind to ensure the function executed in the proper scope.

Arrow functions can have either a "concise body" or the usual "block body".

In a concise body, only an expression is specified, which becomes the implicit return value. In a block body, you must use an explicit `return` statement.

````javascript
var func = x => x * x;
// concise body syntax, implied "return"

var func = (x, y) => { return x + y; };
// with block body, explicit "return" needed
````

## JavaScript Recursive Functions

A recursive function is a [function](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-function/) that calls itself until it doesnâ€™t. And this technique is called recursion.

Suppose that you have a function called `recurse()`. The `recurse()` is a recursive function if it calls itself inside its body, like this:

```javascript
function recurse() {
    // ...
    recurse();
    // ...
}
```

A recursive function always has a condition to stop calling itself. Otherwise, it will call itself indefinitely. So a recursive function typically looks like the following:

```javascript
function recurse() {
    if(condition) {
        // stop calling itself
        //...
    } else {
        recurse();
    }
}
```

Generally, you use recursive functions to break down a big problem into smaller ones. Typically, you will find the recursive functions in data structures like binary trees and graphs and algorithms such as binary search and quicksort.

The following shows the `countDown()` function:

```javascript
function countDown(fromNumber) {
    console.log(fromNumber);
}
countDown(3);
```

This `countDown(3)` shows only the number 3.

To count down from the number 3 to 1, you can:

1. show the number 3.
2. and call the `countDown(2)` that shows the number 2.
3. and call the `countDown(1)` that shows the number 1.

The following changes the `countDown()` to a recursive function:

```javascript
function countDown(fromNumber) {
    console.log(fromNumber);
    countDown(fromNumber-1);
}
countDown(3);
```

This `countDown(3)` will run until the call stack size is exceeded, like this:

```javascript
Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded.
```

â€¦ because it doesnâ€™t have the condition to stop calling itself.

The count down will stop when the next number is zero. Therefore, we add an [if condition](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-if-else/) as follows:

```javascript
function countDown(fromNumber) {
    console.log(fromNumber);

    let nextNumber = fromNumber - 1;

    if (nextNumber > 0) {
        countDown(nextNumber);
    }
}
countDown(3);Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
/*
3
2
1
*/
```

The `countDown()` seems to work as expected.

However the functionâ€™s name is a reference to the actual function object.

If the function name is set to null somewhere in the code, the recursive function will stop working.

For example, the following code will result in an error:

```javascript
let newYearCountDown = countDown;
// somewhere in the code
countDown = null;
// the following function call will cause an error
newYearCountDown(10);
//error: Uncaught TypeError: countDown is not a function
```

How the script works:

- First, assign the `countDown` function name to the variable `newYearCountDown`.
- Second, set the `countDown` function reference to `null`.
- Third, call the `newYearCountDown` function.

The code causes an error because the body of the `countDown()` function references the `countDown` function name, which was set to `null` at the time of calling the function.

To fix it, you can use a named function expression as follows:

```javascript
let countDown = function f(fromNumber) {
    console.log(fromNumber);

    let nextNumber = fromNumber - 1;

    if (nextNumber > 0) {
        f(nextNumber);
    }
}

let newYearCountDown = countDown;
countDown = null;
newYearCountDown(10);
```

Given a number e.g., 324, calculate the sum of digits 3 + 2 + 4 = 9.

To apply the recursive technique, you can use the following steps:

```javascript
f(324) = 4 + f(32)
f(32)  = 2 + f(3)
f(3)   = 3  + 0 (stop here)
```

So

```javascript
f(324) = 4 + f(32) 
f(324) = 4 + 2 + f(3) 
f(324) = 4 + 2 + 3 
```

The following illustrates the `sumOfDigits()` recursive function:

```javascript
function sumOfDigits(num) {
    if (num == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    return num % 10 + sumOfDigits(Math.floor(num / 10));
}Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
```

How it works:

- The `num%10` returns the remainder of the number after divided by 10, e.g., `324 % 10 = 4`
- The `Math.floor(num / 10)` returns the whole part of the `num / 10` e.g., `Math.floor(324 / 10) = 32`
- The `if(num == 0)` is a condition that stops calling the function.

Why Do I Need To Know Recursion? --- I like to watch people suffer lol jk.
