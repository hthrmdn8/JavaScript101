## JavaScript Objects

A Pokémon is an **object**.

A Pokémon has **properties** like name and type, and **methods** like usemoves and outofpokeball:

| Object                                                       | Properties                                                   | Methods                                                      |

All Pokémon have the same **properties**, but the property **values** differ from Pokémon to Pokémon.

All Pokémon have the same **methods**, but the methods are performed **at different times**.

JavaScript variables are containers for data values.

````javascript
let pokemon = "Togepi";
````

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

This code assigns **many values** (Togepi, Normal, 175) to a **variable** named pokemon:

````javascript
const pokemon = {pokemon.name: "Togepi",  pokemon.type: "Normal",  pokemon.id: 175  pokemon.generation: "II"};
````

The values are written as **name:value** pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.

You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:

````javascript
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
````

Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines:

````javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};
````

The **name:values** pairs in JavaScript objects are called **properties**:

| Property  | Property Value |
| :-------- | :------------- |
| firstName | John           |
| lastName  | Doe            |
| age       | 50             |
| eyeColor  | blue           |

You can access object properties in two ways:

````javascript
objectName.propertyName
//or
objectName["propertyName"]
````

JavaScript objects are containers for **named values** called properties.

Objects can also have **methods**.

Methods are **actions** that can be performed on objects.

Methods are stored in properties as **function definitions**.

| Property  | Property Value                                            |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| firstName | John                                                      |
| lastName  | Doe                                                       |
| age       | 50                                                        |
| eyeColor  | blue                                                      |
| fullName  | function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;} |

A method is a function stored as a property.

````javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id       : 5566,
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};
````

In a function definition, `this` refers to the "owner" of the function.

In the example above, `this` is the **person object** that "owns" the `fullName` function.

In other words, `this.firstName` means the `firstName` property of **this object**.

You access an object method with the following syntax:

````javascript
//objectName.methodName()
//Example
const name = person.fullName(); 
````

If you access a method **without** the () parentheses, it will return the **function definition**:

````javascript
const name = person.fullName;
````

When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "`new`", the variable is created as an object:

````javascript
x = new String();        // Declares x as a String object
y = new Number();        // Declares y as a Number object
z = new Boolean();       // Declares z as a Boolean object
````

Avoid `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean` objects. They complicate your code and slow down execution speed.

## JavaScript Strings as Objects

Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values, created from literals

But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword `new`:

An **object** is a collection of related data and operations. An operation that can be carried out on an object is known as a **method**. A piece of data associated with an object is known as a **property**.

````javascript
let y = new String("John");
````

Strings objects are **not best practice**.

The `new` keyword complicates the code and slows down execution speed.

String objects can produce unexpected results:

````javascript
let x = "John";
let y = new String("John");
console.log(x == y); //console: true
console.log(x === y); //console: false
````

Comparing two JavaScript objects **always** returns **false**.

Javascript String is immutable, which means once a String object is assigned to String reference the object value cannot be changed. However, we can still assign a new object to a String reference

````javascript
let myStr = "Hello World";
myVar.toUpperCase();
````

One may think after the first line the *myVar* will become “HELLO WORLD”, but it still equals to “Hello World”. The method will return a new String object it will not change the existing String reference. So we have to assign it to a new variable to get the desired value.

````javascript
let myStrUpperCase = myStr.toUpperCase();
````

It may seem that once a String reference is assigned to a String object it cannot be reused as we can't change the value but we can assign existing String reference a new String object altogether.

````javascript
let str = "Hello World";
str = "Hello World!!!!"; //new String reference assigned
//this will assign return new String reference to myVar object.
str = str.toUpperCase();
````

*Note*: We also cannot assign a new character to an index in String by square bracket notation. As Strings are immutable, by doing that we will be updating the content of String reference which cannot be possible in case of immutability.

````javascript
let myStr = "Hello";
myVar[0] = "i";//still myVar remains same
````

String object has many methods which deal with string characters and all of them returns a new String object instead of modifying the String object on which they are called.

## JavaScript Numbers as Objects

Normally JavaScript numbers are primitive values created from literals:

````javascript
let x = 123;
````

But numbers can also be defined as objects with the keyword `new`:

````javascript
let y = new Number(123);
````

Number objects are **not best practice**.

The `new` keyword complicates the code and slows down execution speed.

Number Objects can produce unexpected results:

````javascript
//When using the == operator, x and y are equal:

let x = 500;
let y = new Number(500);

//When using the === operator, x and y are not equal.

let x = 500;
let y = new Number(500);

//Note the difference between (x==y) and (x===y).
//(x == y) true or false?

let x = new Number(500);
let y = new Number(500);
console.log(x == y); //output: true

//(x === y) true or false?

let x = new Number(500);
let y = new Number(500);
console.log(x === y); //output: false
````



## JavaScript Math Object

The JavaScript Math object allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

Unlike other objects, the Math object has no constructor.

The Math object is static.

All methods and properties can be used without creating a Math object first.

The syntax for any Math property is : `Math.*property*`.

JavaScript provides 8 mathematical constants that can be accessed as Math properties:

````javascript
Math.E        // returns Euler's number
Math.PI       // returns PI
Math.SQRT2    // returns the square root of 2
Math.SQRT1_2  // returns the square root of 1/2
Math.LN2      // returns the natural logarithm of 2
Math.LN10     // returns the natural logarithm of 10
Math.LOG2E    // returns base 2 logarithm of E
Math.LOG10E   // returns base 10 logarithm of E
````

The syntax for Math any methods is : `Math.*method*(*number*)`
