## JavaScript Arrays

An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:

````javascript
const starterPokemon = ["Charmander", "Bulbasaur", "Squirtle"];
````

If you have a list of items (a list of Pokémon names, for example), storing the Pokémon in single variables could look like this

````javascript
let starterPokemon1 = "Charmander";
let starterPokemon2 = "Bulbasaur";
let starterPokemon3 = "Squirtle";
````

However, what if you want to loop through the Pokémon and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 Pokémon, but 150?

The solution is an array!

An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.

Syntax:

````javascript
const array_name = [item1, item2, ...];    
````

It is a common practice to declare arrays with the const keyword.

Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines:

````javascript
const starterPokemon = [
    "Charmander", 
    "Bulbasaur", 
    "Squirtle"
];
````

You can also create an array, and then provide the elements:

````javascript
const starterPokemon = [];
starterPokemon1 = "Charmander"; 
starterPokemon2 = "Bulbasaur"; 
starterPokemon3 = "Squirtle";
````

The following example also creates an Array, and assigns values to it:

````javascript
const starterPokemon = new Array("Charmander", "Bulbasaur", "Squirtle");
````

The two examples above do exactly the same.

There is no need to use `new Array()`.

For simplicity, readability and execution speed, use the array literal method.

You access an array element by referring to the **index number**:

````javascript
const starterPokemon = ["Charmander", "Bulbasaur", "Squirtle"];
let individualStarterPokemon = starterPokemon[0];
````

**Note:** Array indexes start with 0.

[0] is the first element. [1] is the second element.

This statement changes the value of the first element in `starterPokemon`:

````javascript
starterPokemon[0] = "Pikachu";
````

Arrays are a special type of objects. The `typeof` operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.

But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays.

Arrays use **numbers** to access its "elements". In this example, `starterPokemon[0]` returns Charmander:

````javascript
const starterPokemon = ["Charmander", "Bulbasaur", "Squirtle"];
````

Warning !

Array elements can be deleted using the JavaScript operator `delete`.

Using `delete` leaves `undefined` holes in the array.

Use pop() or shift() instead.

By default, the `sort()` function sorts values as **strings**.

This works well for strings ("Apple" comes before "Banana").

However, if numbers are sorted as strings, "25" is bigger than "100", because "2" is bigger than "1".

Because of this, the `sort()` method will produce incorrect result when sorting numbers.

The Difference Between Arrays and Objects

In JavaScript, **arrays** use **numbered indexes**. 

In JavaScript, **objects** use **named indexes**.

Arrays are a special kind of objects, with numbered indexes.

When to Use Arrays. When to use Objects.

- JavaScript does not support associative arrays.
- You should use **objects** when you want the element names to be **strings (text)**.
- You should use **arrays** when you want the element names to be **numbers**.

Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.
