# JavaScript 101

JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language!

JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.

## <u>Why Study JavaScript?</u>

JavaScript is one of the **3 languages** all web developers **must** learn:

1. JavaScript's Vital to the Internet -- Between pop-ups, entry forms, because its already embedded into most popular web browsers

2. Easy to Learn -- JavaScript is a highly abstracted language. This means it reads closer to English than it is to the machine language directly understood by computer processors. JavaScript is also strictly object-oriented. With object-oriented languages, distinct lines of code that can be reused emulate the actions of any sort of object

3. Community Support -- JavaScript is either one of the most popular programming languages around if not the most popular one. There’s a massive amount of help available online

A **computer program** is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called **statements**.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement

````javascript
let a = 0; 
````

When separated by semicolons, multiple statement on one line are allowed

````javascript
let b = 1; let c = 3;
````

JavaScript ignores 'white space', and you can add extra spaces in your code to make it more readable.

````javascript
let a = 0; 
let b = 1;
let c = 3;
````

It is a good practice to add spaces around operators; ( + = - * / )

<u>JavaScript Data Types</u>

In JavaScript there are 5 different data types that can contain values:

- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `object`
- `function`

There are 6 types of objects:

- `Object`
- `Date`
- `Array`
- `String`
- `Number`
- `Boolean`

And 2 data types that cannot contain values:

- `null`
- `undefined`

````javascript
typeof "John"                 // Returns "string"
typeof 3.14                   // Returns "number"
typeof NaN                    // Returns "number"
typeof false                  // Returns "boolean"
typeof [1,2,3,4]              // Returns "object"
typeof {name:'John', age:34}  // Returns "object"
typeof new Date()             // Returns "object"
typeof function () {}         // Returns "function"
typeof myCar                  // Returns "undefined" *
typeof null                   // Returns "object"
````

- The data type of NaN is number
- The data type of an array is object
- The data type of a date is object
- The data type of null is object
- The data type of an undefined variable is **undefined** *
- The data type of a variable that has not been assigned a value is also **undefined** *

You cannot use `typeof` to determine if a JavaScript object is an array (or a date).

## Primitive Data

A primitive data value is a single simple data value with no additional properties and methods.

The `typeof` operator can return one of these primitive types:

- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `undefined`

## Complex Data

The `typeof` operator can return one of two complex types:

- `function`
- `object`

The `typeof` operator returns "object" for objects, arrays, and null.

The `typeof` operator does not return "object" for functions.

The `typeof`operator is not a variable. It is an operator. Operators ( + - * / ) do not have any data type.

The `typeof` operator always **returns a string** (containing the type of the operand).

## Empty Values

An empty value has nothing to do with `undefined`.

An empty string has both a legal value and a type.

## Null

In JavaScript `null` is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.

Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of `null` is an object.

You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that `typeof null` is an object. It should be `null`.

## Difference Between Undefined and Null

`undefined` and `null` are equal in value but different in type

## <u>JavaScript Values</u>

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

- Fixed values
- Variable values

Fixed values are called **Literals**.

Variable values are called **Variables**.

## JavaScript Literals

The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:

1. **Numbers** are written with or without decimals:

````javascript
100324
10.65
-223
7

42,000//not valid because commas treat like a pair of values
````

2. **Strings** are text, written within double or single quotes.

   If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

````javascript
"Hello, World!"
"Pikachu was okay at best but really over hyped"
"There should have only been 3 starter pokemon"
"1002"
'Seriously it's a mouse with static problems 
"Why doesn't anyone take me seriously about this"
'Just a rat'
'Wow a little harsh on pikachu don"t you think??'
````

Console.log can print any values as long as they are separated by commas 

````javascript
console.log(12, 3, "Hello, World!", 4.01, "17"); 
````

Remember not to put commas or spaces in your integers, no matter how big they are. Formal languages are strict, the notation is concise, and even the smallest change might mean something quite different from what you intend

## JavaScript Type Conversions

Most of the time, operators and functions automatically convert the values given to them to the right type.

For example, `alert` automatically converts any value to a string to show it. Mathematical operations convert values to numbers.

There are also cases when we need to explicitly convert a value to the expected type.

````javascript
console.log(Number("2658")); //console: 2658
console.log(typeof Number("2685")); //console: number
console.log(Number(34)); //console: 34
console.log(Number("There is a reason Ash didn't even want pikachu")); //console: NaN --not a number 

console.log(String(2658)); //console: 2658
console.log(typeof String("2685")); //console: string
console.log(String(34)); //console: 34
console.log(String("There is a reason Ash didn't even want pikachu")); //console: There is a reason Ash didn't even want pikachu
````

## JavaScript Variables

In a programming language, **variables** are used to **store** data values.

JavaScript uses the keywords `var`, `let` and `const` to **declare** variables.

All JavaScript **variables** must be **identified** with **unique names**.

These unique names are called **identifiers**.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.

- Names must begin with a letter (special cases use _ , $)

  ​			Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, but professional programmers often use it as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript 				library.

  ​			Using the underscore is not very common in JavaScript, but a convention among professional programmers is to use it as an alias for "private 			(hidden)" variables.

- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)

- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

An **equal sign** is used to **assign values** to variables.

````javascript
let a = "pikachu is overhyped";
let obviouslyTheBestPokemon = "Cydiquill";
````

Avoid saying "A IS EQUAL TO 'pikachu is overhyped'" Instead say "A is **<u>assigned</u>** to the value of 'pikachu is overhyped'"

The `let` keyword tells the code editor to create variables (prefered)

The `const` keyword tells the code editor to create variables. Must be assigned a value when they are declared (Preferred when checks are met)

The `var` keyword also tells the code editor to create variables (not preferred)



## JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript **keywords** are used to identify actions to be performed.

Common JavaScript Keywords:

| Keyword  | Description                                                  |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| var      | Declares a variable                                          |
| let      | Declares a block variable                                    |
| const    | Declares a block constant                                    |
| if       | Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition    |
| switch   | Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases |
| for      | Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop         |
| function | Declares a function                                          |
| return   | Exits a function                                             |
| try      | Implements error handling to a block of statements           |

Reserved Words (you cannot use these words to name variables, labels, functions etc.)

| abstract | arguments  | await*       | Boolean   |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------- |
| break    | byte       | case         | catch     |
| char     | class*     | const        | continue  |
| debugger | default    | delete       | do        |
| double   | else       | enum*        | eval      |
| export*  | extends*   | false        | final     |
| finally  | float      | for          | function  |
| goto     | if         | implements   | import*   |
| in       | instanceof | int          | interface |
| let*     | long       | native       | new       |
| null     | package    | private      | protected |
| public   | return     | short        | static    |
| super*   | switch     | synchronized | this      |
| throw    | throws     | transient    | true      |
| try      | typeof     | var          | void      |
| volatile | while      | with         | yield     |

Words marked with* are new in ECMAScript 5 and 6.

## JavaScript  Declaring  Variables

Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.

````javascript
let a;
````

After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it has the value of `undefined`).

To **assign** a value to the variable, use the equal sign:

You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it:

````javascript
let a;
a = 10;

let b = 10;
````

In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.

A variable declared without a value will have the value `undefined`.

It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.

Let

Variables defined with `let` cannot be Redeclared.

Variables defined with `let` must be Declared before use.

Variables defined with `let` have Block Scope.

You cannot accidentally redeclare a variable defined with let

````javascript
let a = 10;
let a = 11; //console: Syntax Error: 'a' has already been declared
````

Var

Variables defined with `var` can be Redeclared.

Variables declared with the `var` keyword can NOT have block scope.

Redeclaring a variable using the `var` keyword can impose problems.

Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block when using var which can have unintended consequences 

Const

Variables defined with `const` cannot be Redeclared.

Variables defined with `const` cannot be Reassigned.

Variables defined with `const` have Block Scope.

````javascript
const a = 10;
const a = 11; //error
const c = c + 10 //error
const b; //error
b = 5;  //error
````

JavaScript `const` variables must be assigned a value when they are declared

As a general rule, always declare a variable with `const` unless you know that the value will change

The keyword `const` is a little misleading.

It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

Because of this you can NOT:

- Reassign a constant value
- Reassign a constant array
- Reassign a constant object

- But you CAN:

- Change the elements of constant array
- Change the properties of constant object

Block Scope 

In this context block scope means variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block

````javascript
const x = 10;
// Here x is 10

{
const x = 2;
// Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 10
````



## JavaScript Statement Identifiers

JavaScript statements often start with a **statement identifier** to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Statement identifiers are reserved words and cannot be used as variable names (or any other things).

The following table lists all JavaScript statement identifiers:

| Statement                                                    | Description                                                  |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |

| const                                                        | Declares a variable with a constant value                    |
| [class](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_class.asp)     | Declares a class                                             |
| [continue](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_continue.asp) | Breaks one iteration (in the loop) if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop |
| [debugger](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_debugger.asp) | Stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function |
| [do ... while](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_dowhile.asp) | Executes a block of statements and repeats the block while a condition is true |
| [for](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_for.asp)         | Loops through a block of code a number of times              |
| [for ... in](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_forin.asp) | Loops through the properties of an object                    |
| [for ... of](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_forof.asp) | Loops through the values of an iterable object               |
| [function](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_function.asp) | Declares a function                                          |
| [if ... else ... else if](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_if.asp) | Marks a block of statements to be executed depending on a condition |
| let                                                          | Declares a variable inside brackets {} scope                 |
| [return](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_return.asp)   | Stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function |
| [switch](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_switch.asp)   | Marks a block of statements to be executed depending on different cases |
| [throw](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_throw.asp)     | Throws (generates) an error                                  |
| [try ... catch ... finally](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_try_catch.asp) | Marks the block of statements to be executed when an error occurs in a try block, and implements error handling |
| [var](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_var.asp)         | Declares a variable                                          |
| [while](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_while.asp)     | Marks a block of statements to be executed while a condition is true |

## JavaScript is Case Sensitive

All JavaScript identifiers are **case sensitive**. 

The variables `animalCrossing` and `animalcrossing`, are two different variables

````javascript
let animalCrossing, animalcrossing;
animalCrossing = "Isabell isn't helpful";
animalcrossing = "Neither is the Nook family";
````

Variable names need to be written in camelCase as a standard

Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

## JavaScript Operators

JavaScript uses **arithmetic operators** ( `+` `-` `*` `/` ) to **compute** values

 An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.

The computation is called an evaluation.

| Operator | Description                  |
| :------- | :--------------------------- |
| +        | Addition                     |
| -        | Subtraction                  |
| *        | Multiplication               |
| **       | Exponentiation               |
| /        | Division                     |
| %        | Modulus (Division Remainder) |
| ++       | Increment                    |
| --       | Decrement                    |

Order of operations matters in coding mathematics 

````javascript
let a = 1 + 3;
let b = (5 + 7) * 10;
let c = 2 * (10 + 5) - 13;
````

JavaScript uses an **assignment operator** ( `=` ) to **assign** values to variables:

````javascript
let a = 72;
````

Expressions can also contain variable values

````javascript
let x = 5;
console.log(x * 10);  //ouput: 50
````

The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.

````javascript
console.log("I'll admit pikachu is at least top" + " " + 25); //console: I'll admit pikachu is at least top 25
````

## JavaScript Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

| Operator | Example | Same As    |
| :------- | :------ | :--------- |
| =        | x = y   | x = y      |
| +=       | x += y  | x = x + y  |
| -=       | x -= y  | x = x - y  |
| *=       | x *= y  | x = x * y  |
| /=       | x /= y  | x = x / y  |
| %=       | x %= y  | x = x % y  |
| **=      | x **= y | x = x ** y |

````javascript
let x = 10;
x += 5; //console: 15

let z = 10;
z -= 5; //console: 5

let y = 10;
y *= 5; //console: 50
````

## JavaScript String Operators

The `+` operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.

````javascript
let text1 = "Pikachu";
let text2 = "is overhyped";
let text3 = text1 + " " + text2; //console: Pikachu is overhyped
````

The `+=` assignment operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:

````javascript
let text1 = "How dare ";
text1 += "you say that about pikachu";
````

Adding two numbers, will return the sum, but adding a number and a string will return a string:

````javascript
let x = 15 + 5; //console: 20
let y = "15" + 5; //console: 155
let z = "Hello" + 5; //console: Hello5
````

## JavaScript Comments

Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".

Code after double slashes `//` or between `/*` and `*/` is treated as a **comment**.

Comments are ignored, and will not be executed

Single line comments start with `//`.

Any text between `//` and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.

Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by JavaScript.

Using comments to prevent execution of code is suitable for code testing.

Adding `//` in front of a code line changes the code lines from an executable line to a comment.

````javascript
//I will be ignored

/*Same
*/

/*
me too
*/ I wont

me neither 

//the code below assigns a the value of 2 + 3
let a = 2 + 3;
````

JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.

JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

## JavaScript Character Set

JavaScript uses the **Unicode** character set.

Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world. 

The **Unicode Standard** provides a unique number for every character, no matter the platform, device, application, or language. **UTF-8** is a popular Unicode encoding which has 88-bit code units.

## JavaScript Unicode

There are several ways that Unicode may be needed in JavaScript. These include:

- Unicode in JavaScript source code.

- Unicode in JavaScript strings.

- Unicode in JavaScript source code

  In JavaScript, the identifiers and string literals can be expressed in Unicode via a Unicode escape sequence. The general syntax is `\uXXXX`, where X denotes four hexadecimal digits. For example, the letter `o` is denoted as ‘\u006F’ in Unicode. Hence, to write the letter “foo” in Unicode, we can use the following code.

````javascript
let f\u006F\u006F = 'abc';
console.log(foo)
````

#JavaScript String Methods/Properties

A **JavaScript property** is a characteristic of an object, often describing attributes associated with a data structure

Strings are objects, but that is covered in greater detail in later chapters. No need to worry about that now.

Dot notation is one way to access a property of an object. To use dot notation, **write the name of the object, followed by a dot (.), followed by the name of the property**.

There are 3 methods for extracting a part of a string:

- `slice(*start*, *end*)`

- `substring(*start*, *end*)`

- `substr(*start*, *length*)`

  `slice()` extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.

  The method takes 2 parameters: the start position, and the end position (end not included).

  ````javascript
  let str = "Heather, Keifer, Xena";
  let part = str.slice(9, 15); //output : Heather, Xena
  ````

  JavaScript counts positions from zero. First position is 0.

  If a parameter is negative, the position is counted from the end of the string.

  ````java
  let str = "Heather, Keifer, Xena";
  let part = str.slice(-12, -6); //output : Heather, Xena
  ````

  If you omit the second parameter, the method will slice out the rest of the string:

  ````javascript
  let str = "Heather, Keifer, Xena";
  let part = str.slice(7); //output : Heather
  ````

  or, counting from the end:

  ````javascript
  let str = "Heather, Keifer, Xena";
  let part = str.slice(-12); //output : Heather
  ````

  `substring()` is similar to `slice()`.

  The difference is that `substring()` cannot accept negative indexes.

  ````javascript
  let str = "Heather, Keifer, Xena";
  let part = substring(7, 13); //output : Heather, Xena
  ````

  If you omit the second parameter, `substring()` will slice out the rest of the string.

  ````javascript
  let str = "Heather, Keifer, Xena";
  let part = str.substr(7); //output : Heather
  ````

  If the first parameter is negative, the position counts from the end of the string.

  ````javascript
  let str = "Heather, Keifer, Xena";
  let part = str.substr(-4); //output : Xena
  ````

  The `replace()` method replaces a specified value with another value in a string:

  ````javascript
  let text = "Pickachu is the best!";
  let newText = text.replace("Pikachu", "Cydiquill"); //output: Cydiquill is the best!
  ````

  The `replace()` method does not change the string it is called on. It returns a new string.

  By default, the `replace()` method replaces **only the first** match

  

  ````javascript
  let text = "Pikachu is the best! Pikachu is okay at best!";
  let newText = text.replace("Pikachu", "Cydiquill"); //output: Cydiquill is the best! Pikachu is okay at best!
  ````

  By default, the `replace()` method is case sensitive

  To replace case insensitive, use a **regular expression** with an `/i` flag (insensitive)

  

  ````javascript
  let text = "PIkAchU is the best! Pikachu is okay at best!";
  let newText = text.replace(/PIKACHU/i, "Cydiquill"); //output: Cydiquill is the best Pikachu is okay at best!!
  ````

  To replace all matches, use a **regular expression** with a `/g` flag (global match):

  

  ````javascript
  let text = "Pikachu is the best! Yeah Pikachu is the best!";
  let newText = text.replace(/Pikachu/g, "Cydiquill"); //output: Cydiquill is the best! Cydiquill is okay at best!
  ````

  A string is converted to upper case with `toUpperCase()`

  A string is converted to lower case with `toLowerCase()`

  ````javascript
  let text1 = "Hello World!";
  let text2 = text1.toUpperCase();
  let text3 = "Hello World!";
  let text4 = text3.toUpperCase();
  ````

  `concat()` joins two or more strings

  ````javascript
  let text1 = "Hello";
  let text2 = "World";
  let text3 = text1.concat(" ", text2);
  ````

  The `concat()` method can be used instead of the plus operator.

  ````javascript
  let text = "Hello" + " " + "World!";
  let text = "Hello".concat(" ", "World!");
  ````

  The `trim()` method removes whitespace from both sides of a string

  ````javascript
  let text = "      Hello World!      ";
  let text.trim()
  ````

  ECMAScript 2017 added two String methods: `padStart` and `padEnd` to support padding at the beginning and at the end of a string.

  ````javascript
  let text1 = "7";
  let padded1 = text.padStart(4,0);
  let text2 = "5";
  let padded2 = text.padEnd(4,0);
  ````

  The `charAt()` method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string

  ````javascript
  let text = "HELLO WORLD";
  let char = text.charAt(0);
  ````

  ECMAScript 5 (2009) allows property access [ ] on strings

  ````javascript
  let text = "HELLO WORLD";
  let char = text[0];
  ````

  Property access might be a little **unpredictable:**

  - It makes strings look like arrays (but they are not)
  - If no character is found, [ ] returns undefined, while charAt() returns an empty string.
  - It is read only. str[0] = "A" gives no error (but does not work!)

  ````javascript
  let text = "HELLO WORLD";
  text[0] = "A";    //console: Gives no error, but does not work
  ````

  A string can be converted to an array with the `split()` method:

  ````javascript
  let text = "Stardew|Valley, Where all your dreams come true"
  text.split(",")    // Split on commas
  text.split(" ")    // Split on spaces
  text.split("|")    // Split on pipe
  ````

  If the separator is omitted, the returned array will contain the whole string in index [0].

  If the separator is "", the returned array will be an array of single characters:

  ````javascript
  let text = "Stardew|Valley, Where all your dreams come true"
  text.split("") 
  ````
