## JavaScript Numbers

JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals.

```javascript
let x = 7.34;    // A number with decimals
let y = 11;       // A number without decimals
```

Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponent) notation:

````javascript
let x = 123e5;    // 12300000
let y = 123e-5;   // 0.00123
````

Unlike many other programming languages, JavaScript does not define different types of numbers, like integers, short, long, floating-point etc.

JavaScript numbers are always stored as double precision floating point numbers, following the international IEEE 754 standard.

This format stores numbers in 64 bits, where the number (the fraction) is stored in bits 0 to 51, the exponent in bits 52 to 62, and the sign in bit 63:

| Value (aka Fraction/Mantissa) | Exponent          | Sign       |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------- | :--------- |
| 52 bits (0 - 51)              | 11 bits (52 - 62) | 1 bit (63) |

Integers (numbers without a period or exponent notation) are accurate up to 15 digits.

````javascript
let x = 999999999999999;   // x will be 999999999999999
let y = 9999999999999999;  // y will be 10000000000000000
````

The maximum number of decimals is 17.

Floating point arithmetic is not always 100% accurate:

````javascript
let x = 0.2 + 0.1;
console.log(x) //output: 0.30000000000000004

````

To solve the problem above, it helps to multiply and divide:

````javascript
let x = (0.2 * 10 + 0.1 * 10) / 10;
console.log(x) //output: 0.3
````

JavaScript uses the + operator for both addition and concatenation.

Numbers are added. Strings are concatenated.

````javascript
//If you add two numbers, the result will be a number:

let x = 100;
let y = 200;
let z = x + y;
console.log(z) //output: 300

//If you add two strings, the result will be a string concatenation:

let x = "100";
let y = "200";
let z = x + y;
console.log(z) //output: 100200

//If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string concatenation:

let x = 100;
let y = "200";
let z = x + y;
console.log(z) //output: 100200

//If you add a string and a number, the result will be a string concatenation:

let x = "100";
let y = 200; 
let z = x + y;
console.log(z) //output: 100200

//A common mistake is to expect this result to be 30:

let x = 100;
let y = 200;
let z = "The result is: " + x + y;
console.log(z) //output: The result is: 100200

//A common mistake is to expect this result to be 100200300:

let x = 100;
let y = 200;
let z = "300";
let result = x + y + z;
console.log(result) //output: 300300
````

The JavaScript interpreter works from left to right.

First 10 + 20 is added because x and y are both numbers.

Then 30 + "30" is concatenated because z is a string.

````javascript
//JavaScript strings can have numeric content:

let x = 100;         // x is a number

let y = "100";       // y is a string

//JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers in all numeric operations:

//This will work:

let x = "100";
let y = "10";
let z = x / y;
console.log(z); //output: 10

//This will also work:

let x = "100";
let y = "10";
let z = x * y;
console.log(z); //output: 1000

//And this will work:

let x = "100";
let y = "10";
let z = x - y;
console.log(z); //output: 90

//But this will not work:

let x = "100";
let y = "10";
let z = x + y;
console.log(z); //output: 10010

//In the last example JavaScript uses the + operator to concatenate the strings.
````

`NaN` is a JavaScript reserved word indicating that a number is not a legal number.

````javascript
//Trying to do arithmetic with a non-numeric string will result in NaN (Not a Number):

let x = 100 / "Apple";
console.log(x); //output: NaN

//However, if the string contains a numeric value , the result will be a number:

let x = 100 / "10";
console.log(x); //output: 10

//You can use the global JavaScript function isNaN() to find out if a value is a not a number:

let x = 100 / "Apple";
isNaN(x); //output: true

//Watch out for NaN. If you use NaN in a mathematical operation, the result will also be NaN:

let x = NaN;
let y = 5;
let z = x + y;
console.log(z); //output: NaN

//Or the result might be a concatenation like NaN5:

let x = NaN;
let y = "5";
let z = x + y;
console.log(z); //output: NaN5

//NaN is a number: typeof NaN returns number:

typeof NaN; //output: number
````

Infinity (or -Infinity) is the value JavaScript will return if you calculate a number outside the largest possible number.

````javascript
let myNumber = 2;
// Execute until Infinity

while (myNumber != Infinity) {
  myNumber = myNumber * myNumber;
}
console.log(myNumber); //output: Infinity

//Division by 0 (zero) also generates Infinity:

let x =  2 / 0;
let y = -2 / 0;
console.log(x); //output: Infinity
console.log(y); //output: -Infinity

//Infinity is a number: typeof Infinity returns number.

typeof Infinity; //output: number
````

JavaScript interprets numeric constants as hexadecimal if they are preceded by 0x.

````javascript
let x = 0xFF;
console.log(x); //output : 255
````

Never write a number with a leading zero (like 07).
Some JavaScript versions interpret numbers as octal if they are written with a leading zero.

By default, JavaScript displays numbers as **base 10** decimals.

But you can use the `toString()` method to output numbers from **base 2** to **base 36**.

Hexadecimal is **base 16**. Decimal is **base 10**. Octal is **base 8**. Binary is **base 2**.

````javascript
let myNumber = 32;
myNumber.toString(10); //output: 32
myNumber.toString(32); //output: 10
myNumber.toString(16); //output: 20
myNumber.toString(8); //output: 40
myNumber.toString(2); //output: 100000
````
