## JavaScript Boolean

In programing we have a datatype that only has two values, `Boolean`. 

`Boolean` data types can only have the values true or false.

`Boolean` data types are very important will ask a question, and will normally start with 'is'.

`Boolean` statements are very specific about what question is being asked. 

You can use the `Boolean()` function to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true

````javascript
console.log(Boolean("true")); //console: true
console.log(Boolean("TRUE")); //console: true
console.log(Boolean(0)); //console: false
console.log(Boolean(1)); //console: true
console.log(Boolean('')); //console: false
console.log(Boolean('LaunchCode')); //console: true
console.log(Boolean(-1)); //console: true
````

Conversion table

| Original Value   | Converted to Number | Converted to String | Converted to Boolean |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| FALSE            | 0                   | "false"             | FALSE                |
| TRUE             | 1                   | "true"              | TRUE                 |
| 0                | 0                   | "0"                 | FALSE                |

| NaN              | NaN                 | "NaN"               | FALSE                |
| Infinity         | Infinity            | "Infinity"          | TRUE                 |

| ""               | 0                   | ""                  | FALSE                |
| "20"             | 20                  | "20"                | TRUE                 |
| "twenty"         | NaN                 | "twenty"            | TRUE                 |
| [ ]              | 0                   | ""                  | TRUE                 |
| [20]             | 20                  | "20"                | TRUE                 |
| [10,20]          | NaN                 | "10,20"             | TRUE                 |
| ["twenty"]       | NaN                 | "twenty"            | TRUE                 |
| ["ten","twenty"] | NaN                 | "ten,twenty"        | TRUE                 |
| function(){}     | NaN                 | "function(){}"      | TRUE                 |
| { }              | NaN                 | "[object Object]"   | TRUE                 |
| null             | 0                   | "null"              | FALSE                |
| undefined        | NaN                 | "undefined"         | FALSE                |

`Boolean` data types are useful for comparing two values

````javascript
Boolean(6 == 7); //output: false
Boolean(10 < 33); //output: true
Boolean(26 > (5 + 3) * 4) //output: false
Boolean("Pikachu" == "Best Pokemon Ever")  //output: false
Boolean("5" == 5)  //output: true
Boolean("five" == 5)  //output: false
Boolean(false == 0)  //output: true
Boolean(true == 1)  //output: true
Boolean(true == -1)  //output: false
````

For the example above if we run all of the statements at once it will only give us the answer to the last comparison. This is a caveat of Repl.it. Even though we are not telling the console to print, or log anything it still gives us the answer to the last equation. 

## JavaScript Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description                       |
| :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| ==       | equal to                          |
| ===      | equal value and equal type        |
| !=       | not equal                         |
| !==      | not equal value or not equal type |
| >        | greater than                      |
| <        | less than                         |
| >=       | greater than or equal to          |
| <=       | less than or equal to             |
| ?        | ternary operator                  |

In order to make a comparison in JavaScript it is important that we are comparing the same data types. JavaScript can compare values that are not the same data type, but this can have unintended consequences. 

When doing a comparison from string to another datatype JavaScript always converts the other data type to a string. 

We use `==` if the two are different data types, but with conversion there is almost no real life context where you will ever need to use `==`

 The `===` operator behaves identically to the abstract equality operator `==` except no type conversion is done, and the types must be the same to be considered equal 

To quote Douglas Crockford's  [JavaScript: The Good Parts](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0596517742),

> JavaScript has two sets of equality operators: `===` and `!==`, and their evil twins `==` and `!=`. The good ones work the way you would expect. If the two operands are of the same type and have the same value, then `===` produces `true` and `!==` produces `false`. The evil twins do the right thing when the operands are of the same type, but if they are of different types, they attempt to coerce the values. The rules by which they do that are complicated and unmemorable. These are some of the interesting cases:

````javascript
'' == '0'           //console: false
0 == ''             //console: true
0 == '0'            //console: true

false == 'false'    //console: false
false == '0'        //console: true

false == undefined  //console: false
false == null       //console: false
null == undefined   //console: true

' \t\r\n ' == 0     //console: true
````

For objects, `==` and `===` act consistently with one another (except in a special case).

```js
let a = [1,2,3];
let b = [1,2,3];

let c = { x: 1, y: 2 };
let d = { x: 1, y: 2 };

let e = "text";
let f = "te" + "xt";

a == b            // false
a === b           // false

c == d            // false
c === d           // false

e == f            // true
e === f           // true
```

The special case is when you compare a primitive with an object that evaluates to the same primitive, due to its `toString` or `valueOf` method. For example, consider the comparison of a string primitive with a string object created using the `String` constructor.

```js
"abc" == new String("abc")    // true
"abc" === new String("abc")   // false
```

Here the `==` operator is checking the values of the two objects and returning `true`, but the `===` is seeing that they're not the same type and returning `false`. Which one is correct? That really depends on what you're trying to compare. My advice is to bypass the question entirely and just don't use the `String` constructor to create string objects from string literals.

`char1 === char2`

When using `===` for JavaScript equality testing, everything is as is.
Nothing gets converted before being evaluated.

## JavaScript Logical Operators

| Operator | Description |
| :------- | :---------- |
| &&       | logical and |
| \|\|     | logical or  |
| !        | logical not |

A **compound boolean expression** is a boolean expression built out of smaller boolean expressions. JavaScript allows us to create a compound boolean expression using these three logical operators.

&& (and) takes two operands, and only results in true if both operands are true. If one, or both are false the overall expression is false

|| (or) takes two operands, and results in true if either operands are true. Only if both operands are false will the overall expression be false

! (bang/not) takes only one operand, and reverses its boolean value. 

Operator precedence is the set of rules that dictate in which order the operators are applied.

JavaScript will always apply the logical NOT operator, `!`, first. Next, it applies the arithmetic operators, followed by the comparison operators. The logical AND and OR are applied last

| Precedence |          Category           |        Operators         |
| :--------: | :-------------------------: | :----------------------: |
| (highest)  |         Logical NOT         |           `!`            |
|            |       Exponentiation        |           `**`           |
|            | Multiplication and division |      `*`, `/`, `%`       |
|            |  Addition and subtraction   |         `+`, `-`         |
|            |         Comparison          |   `<=`, `>=`, `>`, `<`   |
|            |          Equality           | `===`, `!==`, `==`, `!=` |
|            |         Logical AND         |           `&&`           |
|  (lowest)  |         Logical OR          |           `||`           |

## JavaScript Truth Tables

The truth tables tell us what the truthiness of an *expression* is based on the truthiness of its *parts*.

For instance, the first row in the Negation truth table (below) should be read like this: “if statement A is True, then the expression !A is False.”

![img](https://miro.medium.com/max/1270/1*SX5-E0EOlfb-HfuttEblHw.png)

The **Negation** table is very straightforward. Negation is the only unary logical operator, meaning it acts on a single input. This means that `!A || B` should not be considered the same as `!(A || B)`. Parentheses act like grouping notation similar to what you’d find in mathematics.

There are two big caveats to treating JavaScript code like propositional logic: **short circuiting** and **order of operations**.

Short circuiting is something that JavaScript engines do to save time by not evaluating something that will not change the output of the whole expression. The function `doSomething()` in the following examples is never called because no matter what it returned, the outcome of the logical expression wouldn’t change:

````javascript
// doSomething() is never called
false && doSomething();
true || doSomething();
````

## JavaScript Conditionals

## Conditional Statements

Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

- Use `if` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use `else` to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use `else if` to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use `switch` to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

Use the `if` statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.

````javascript
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good Morning Ducklings!";
}
````

Use the `else` statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

````javascript
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good Morning Ducklings!";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
````

Use the `else if` statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

````javascript
if (time < 10) {
  greeting = "Good Morning Ducklings!";
} else if (time < 20) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
````

Use the `switch` statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

This is how it works:

- The switch expression is evaluated once.
- The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
- If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

````javascript
switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 0:
    day = "Sunday";
    break;
  case 1:
    day = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
     day = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    day = "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    day = "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    day = "Friday";
    break;
  case 6:
    day = "Saturday";
}
````

## JavaScript Nested Conditionals 

Embedding conditional statement inside another conditional statement is called a Nested conditional statement.

````javascript
if ( test condition 1)
{
 
   //If the test condition 1 is TRUE then these it will check for test condition 2
   if ( test condition 2)
   {
    //If the test condition 2 is TRUE then these statements will be executed
    Test condition 2 True statements;
   }

   else
   {
    //If the c test condition 2 is FALSE then these statements will be executed
    Test condition 2 False statements;
   }

else
{
 //If the test condition 1 is FALSE then these statements will be executed
 Test condition 1 False statements;
}
````

![FLOW CHART For Nested If in C Programming](https://www.tutorialgateway.org/wp-content/uploads/NESTED-IF-FLOW-CHART.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:521x338/rscb179/ng:webp/ngcb179)

If the Test Condition1 is FALSE, then STATEMENT3 will execute. If Test Condition1 is TRUE, then it will check for the Test Condition2, and if it is TRUE, STATEMENT1 will execute else STATEMENT2.
